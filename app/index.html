					<h3>The Masked Lords of Waterdeep</h3>
				</div>
				<div class="mdl-cell mdl-cell--8-col mdl-cell--1-offset-tablet mdl-cell--1-offset-desktop">
					<p>
						Long had the 12 masked lords of Waterdeep ruled from the shadows. A history of benevolence
						towards the
						citizens
						of the city had allowed them to operate without regard for oversight. Their favor spread
						secretly across the
						land and much good was attributed to their names, whether or not they actually had a hand in its
						creation.
					</p>
					<p>
						The 12 masked lords were akin to their own pantheon of gods. As the people began to believe and
						trust in
						them,
						there seemed no need to continue with the worship of the deities of the land. Temples fell into
						dissuse and
						still Waterdeep flourished.
					</p>
					<p>
						Their prosperity attracted peoples from all over the Sword Coast and beyond. Waterdeep gradually
						became a
						melting pot of all kinds of peoples; dragonborn, gnomes, elves, even the occasional tiefling was
						not
						uncommon.
						As more people joined the city the economy stagnated as job creation could not outpace the
						population
						growth.
					</p>
					<p>
						Behind closed doors the 12 masked lords were split on how to best handle the swelling of growth.
						Their
						bickering and arguing led to inaction. The people began to grow restless. Native Waterdeepians
						were going
						hungry while outsiders took their jobs for less pay. The silence of the masked lords became the
						rejection of
						the people by their own gods. Fear crashed into market stalls leaving destruction in the
						streets.
					</p>

				<div class="mdl-cell mdl-cell--12-col mdl-cell--1-offset-tablet mdl-cell--1-offset-desktop">
					<h3>The Rise of Fing Ch'Nal and the People's Protectorate</h3>
				</div>
				<div class="mdl-cell mdl-cell--8-col mdl-cell--1-offset-tablet mdl-cell--1-offset-desktop">
					<p>
						Much of what is known of Fing Ch'Nal prior to his rise is contested. Some say he was a powerful
						mage
						in the
						Arcane University of Evocation. Others say he was one of the masked lords and grew sick of their
						petty
						squabbles. What is known is that he was influential with the people and he was well funded.
					</p>
					<p>
						No one in Waterdeep will ever forget when he unmasked the first lord of Waterdeep in the public
						square.
						Calling all to look on the face of one of the men they had once revered who had led them to this
						mess. One by
						one Fing demystified their lords.
					</p>
					<p>
						This effort for transparency and call for governmental self direction won much favor with the
						wizards of
						Waterdeep. Most of the wizard colleges supported his efforts. The college of illusion was the
						only
						major
						exception, taking a hard stance against these revelations.
					</p>
					<p>
						Taking advantage of the momentum of the people, Fing setup a political party called the People's
						Protectorate. His party incited the people's fears and within weeks half of the 12 unmasked
						lords of
						Waterdeep had "dissappeared" or been executed in mock public trials. Their sentence "Crimes
						against
						the people of Waterdeep", a convenient creation of the People's Protectorate.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="mdl-cell mdl-cell--12-col mdl-cell--1-offset-tablet mdl-cell--1-offset-desktop">
					<h3>Ascension and Exodus</h3>
				</div>
				<div class="mdl-cell mdl-cell--8-col mdl-cell--1-offset-tablet mdl-cell--1-offset-desktop">
					<p>
						Rallying the masses to his call, "Make Waterdeep Great Again", Fing Ch'Nal asked the people to
						let him lead them to a glorious new era of peace and prosperity. The people made him their King.
						The city of Waterdeep was his to rule. The people were excited and calls for action continued.
					</p>
					<p>
						King Fing Ch'Nal's first royal decree was to call for the registration of all the citizens. At
						the same time he created jobs through the biggest public works program the city had ever seen,
						the fortification of Waterdeep. During the three years of the walls construction, the People's
						Protectorate began to spread lies about plots by the more unusual races to destroy the wall.
						People began to mistrust neighbors they had known their whole lives, simply because of their
						race.
					</p>
					<p>
						On the day of the wall's completion King Fing Ch'Nal ordered all races deemed "not human
						enough", or NHE to be exiled from the kingdom. A mass exodus began and since that time no one
						has seen gnomes, dragonborn, tieflings or any other of the NHE races in the Sword Coast. With
						the decrease in population the prosperity returned and the people slowly forgot their exiled
						friends. Many justified that it had to be done, "It was us or them".
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="mdl-cell mdl-cell--12-col mdl-cell--1-offset-tablet mdl-cell--1-offset-desktop">
					<h3>Paranoia</h3>
				</div>
				<div class="mdl-cell mdl-cell--8-col mdl-cell--1-offset-tablet mdl-cell--1-offset-desktop">
					<p>
						With no internal enemies present, King Fing Ch'Nal looked outside the walls of Waterdeep for new
						opponents. Using his Arcane armies, evocation wizards of impressive strength, he quickly swept
						across all remaining human towns. Insisting that his policies could benefit them as well. If
						they refused, the devastation left by the Arcane Armies was complete. Baldur's Gate was left a
						crater of ashe and rubble. Neverwinter was sunk into the Sea of Swords.
					</p>
					<p>
						The dwarves took note of the utter destruction the King brought upon his own race. As proud as
						they were they could not subject their people to such obliteration. They agreed to subject their
						race and cities to the King.
					</p>
					<p>
						The elves fought many skirmishes and using guerilla warfare tactics were able to avoid complete
						destruction. They retreated deep into the great woods of the Sword Coast. Upon seeing this the
						King ordered the High Forest burnt. When the reconnaisance team entered the charred remains of
						the forest there was sign of the elves, only a scorched forest leading up to the Star Mounts.
						The King declared that they had been defeated in glorious battle and with this fianl victory
						extended his rule to include the entire Sword Coast.
					</p>
					<p>
						Having no enemies left to oppose him, the King in his madness created one from his paranoid
						mind. His suspicions turned to the organized wizard universities of the Sword Coast. Fearing
						what they could do if they were to unite and oppose him he ordered the use of all magic illegal.
						The one exception was wizards with government sanction. Public use of unsanctioned magic in the
						Sword Coast was punishable by death. The People's Protectorate made sure that the people
						understood that this was for their safety.
					</p>
					<p>
						Only three of the wizard universities resisted successfully; the Waxing Moon School of Illusion,
						the Double Negative School of abjuration, and the Third Eye School of Divination. To this day
						they operate as an underground network of student and masters of now illegal magical arts.
					</p>

					<h3>Legacy</h3>
				</div>
				<div
					class="mdl-cell mdl-cell--8-col mdl-cell--1-offset-tablet mdl-cell--1-offset-desktop bottom-spacing">
					<p>
						Using his Arcane Archaeologists and Arcane Armies, the King continues to seek all magical
						power. His goal is to continue to prevent the use of magic by stockpiling it and classifying
						its secrets. Slowly the world is being drained of magic in the name of peace...
					</p>
					<p>
						Not all believe in the greatness of the King. There is a small underground movement growing.
						Most concern themselves with criminal activity and spying. However, in the face of such
						prosperity there are few that have reason to join this cause. Where will you stand?
