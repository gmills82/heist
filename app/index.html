					<h3>The Masked Lords of Waterdeep</h3>
				</div>
				<div class="mdl-cell mdl-cell--8-col mdl-cell--1-offset-tablet mdl-cell--1-offset-desktop">
					<p>
						Long had the 12 masked lords of Waterdeep ruled from the shadows. A history of benevolence
						towards the
						citizens
						of the city had allowed them to operate without regard for oversight. Their favor spread
						secretly across the
						land and much good was attributed to their names, whether or not they actually had a hand in its
						creation.
					</p>
					<p>
						The 12 masked lords were akin to their own pantheon of gods. As the people began to believe and
						trust in
						them,
						there seemed no need to continue with the worship of the deities of the land. Temples fell into
						dissuse and
						still Waterdeep flourished.
					</p>
					<p>
						Their prosperity attracted peoples from all over the Sword Coast and beyond. Waterdeep gradually
						became a
						melting pot of all kinds of peoples; dragonborn, gnomes, elves, even the occasional tiefling was
						not
						uncommon.
						As more people joined the city the economy stagnated as job creation could not outpace the
						population
						growth.
					</p>
					<p>
						Behind closed doors the 12 masked lords were split on how to best handle the swelling of growth.
						Their
						bickering and arguing led to inaction. The people began to grow restless. Native Waterdeepians
						were going
						hungry while outsiders took their jobs for less pay. The silence of the masked lords became the
						rejection of
						the people by their own gods. Fear crashed into market stalls leaving destruction in the
						streets.
					</p>

					<h3>The Rise of Fing Ch'Nal and the People's Protectorate</h3>
				</div>
				<div class="mdl-cell mdl-cell--8-col mdl-cell--1-offset-tablet mdl-cell--1-offset-desktop">
					<p>
						Much of what is known of Fing Ch'Nal prior to his rise is contested. Some say he was a powerful
						mage
						in the
						Arcane University of Evocation. Others say he was one of the masked lords and grew sick of their
						petty
						squabbles. What is known is that he was influential with the people and he was well funded.
					</p>
					<p>
						No one in Waterdeep will ever forget when he unmasked the first lord of Waterdeep in the public
						square.
						Calling all to look on the face of one of the men they had once revered who had led them to this
						mess. One by
						one Fing demystified their lords.
					</p>
					<p>
						This effort for transparency and call for governmental self direction won much favor with the
						wizards of
						Waterdeep. Most of the wizard colleges supported his efforts. The college of illusion was the
						only
						major
						exception, taking a hard stance against these revelations.
					</p>
					<p>
						Taking advantage of the momentum of the people, Fing setup a political party called the People's
						Protectorate. His party incited the people's fears and within weeks half of the 12 unmasked
						lords of
						Waterdeep had "dissappeared" or been executed in mock public trials. Their sentence "Crimes
						against
						the people of Waterdeep", a convenient creation of the People's Protectorate.
					</p>

				<div class="mdl-cell mdl-cell--12-col mdl-cell--1-offset-tablet mdl-cell--1-offset-desktop">
					<h3>Ascension and Exodus</h3>
				</div>
				<div class="mdl-cell mdl-cell--8-col mdl-cell--1-offset-tablet mdl-cell--1-offset-desktop">
					<p>
						Rallying the masses to his call, "Make Waterdeep Great Again", Fing Ch'Nal asked the people to
						let him lead them to a glorious new era of peace and prosperity. The people made him their King.
						The city of Waterdeep was his to rule. The people were excited and calls for action continued.
					</p>
					<p>
						King Fing Ch'Nal's first royal decree was to call for the registration of all the citizens. At
						the same time he created jobs through the biggest public works program the city had ever seen,
						the fortification of Waterdeep. During the three years of the walls construction, the People's
						Protectorate began to spread lies about plots by the more unusual races to destroy the wall.
						People began to mistrust neighbors they had known their whole lives, simply because of their
						race.
					</p>
					<p>
						On the day of the wall's completion King Fing Ch'Nal ordered all races deemed "not human
						enough", or NHE to be exiled from the kingdom. A mass exodus began and since that time no one
						has seen gnomes, dragonborn, tieflings or any other of the NHE races in the Sword Coast. With
						the decrease in population the prosperity returned and the people slowly forgot their exiled
						friends. Many justified that it had to be done, "It was us or them".
					</p>

				<div class="mdl-cell mdl-cell--12-col mdl-cell--1-offset-tablet mdl-cell--1-offset-desktop">
					<h3>Paranoia</h3>
				</div>
				<div class="mdl-cell mdl-cell--8-col mdl-cell--1-offset-tablet mdl-cell--1-offset-desktop">
					<p>
						With no internal enemies present, King Fing Ch'Nal looked outside the walls of Waterdeep for new
						opponents. Using his Arcane armies, evocation wizards of impressive strength, he quickly swept
						across all remaining human towns. Insisting that his policies could benefit them as well. If
						they refused, the devastation left by the Arcane Armies was complete. Baldur's Gate was left a
						crater of ashe and rubble. Neverwinter was sunk into the Sea of Swords.
					</p>
					<p>
						The dwarves took note of the utter destruction the King brought upon his own race. As proud as
						they were they could not subject their people to such obliteration. They agreed to subject their
						race and cities to the King.
					</p>
					<p>
						The elves fought many skirmishes and using guerilla warfare tactics were able to avoid complete
						destruction. They retreated deep into the great woods of the Sword Coast. Upon seeing this the
						King ordered the High Forest burnt. When the reconnaisance team entered the charred remains of
						the forest there was sign of the elves, only a scorched forest leading up to the Star Mounts.
						The King declared that they had been defeated in glorious battle and with this fianl victory
						extended his rule to include the entire Sword Coast.
					</p>
					<p>
						Having no enemies left to oppose him, the King in his madness created one from his paranoid
						mind. His suspicions turned to the organized wizard universities of the Sword Coast. Fearing
						what they could do if they were to unite and oppose him he ordered the use of all magic illegal.
						The one exception was wizards with government sanction. Public use of unsanctioned magic in the
						Sword Coast was punishable by death. The People's Protectorate made sure that the people
						understood that this was for their safety.
					</p>
					<p>
						Only three of the wizard universities resisted successfully; the Waxing Moon School of Illusion,
						the Double Negative School of Abjuration, and the Third Eye School of Divination. To this day
						they operate as an underground network of student and masters of now illegal magical arts.

					<h3>Legacy</h3>

				<div
					class="mdl-cell mdl-cell--8-col mdl-cell--1-offset-tablet mdl-cell--1-offset-desktop bottom-spacing">
					<p>
						Using his Arcane Archaeologists and Arcane Armies, the King continues to seek all magical
						power. His goal is to continue to prevent the use of magic by stockpiling it and classifying
						its secrets. Slowly the world is being drained of magic in the name of peace...
					</p>
					<p>
						Not all believe in the greatness of the King. There is a small underground movement growing.
						Most concern themselves with criminal activity and spying. However, in the face of such
						prosperity there are few that have reason to join this cause. Where will you stand?

		<!--Alternate World Rules-->
		<div class="mdl-layout__tab-panel" id="altrules">
			<section class="section--center mdl-grid mdl-grid--no-spacing">
				<div class="mdl-cell mdl-cell--12-col">
					<h3>Alternate World Rules</h3>

					<h4>Magic is not commonly seen</h4>
					<p>
						Only government sanctioned magic is allowed to be displayed in public. Since its use is mostly
						limited to wizards supporting the Arcane Army the public doesn't see this and is used to a very
						simple world. The King has deemed that unsanctioned use of magic is tantamount to aggravated
						assault against the people of his kingdom.
					</p>

					<h4>Cash is king</h4>
					<p>
						Gold greases the wheels of legal and illegal commerce. Everything costs gold. Everything!.
						Levelling up Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma requires the
						proper training from people in town. These costs increase as you get closer and closer to 20 to
						reflect the increased complexity and rarity of training at this level. Similarly, feat
						acquisition costs an increasing amount of gold the more feats you train.
					</p>

					<h4>Cover Identities</h4>
					<p>
						When creating your character, choose your real name and keep it secret. Also choose your cover
						name that you will present to the group. If you pay to change your cover, to frustrate efforts
						to pursue you, then the crew must address you by that new cover identity. Exposing your real
						identity to anyone is a supremely dangerous idea to you and your loved ones.
					</p>

					<h4>Hideout Havens</h4>
					<p>
						Hideouts offer places to plan your heists, keep crew gold and items safe, and meet with faction
						contacts. Entering a hideout while not directly being observed completely stops all active
						pursuits of you. The world is not kind to criminals, the hideout is your haven.
					</p>

					<h4>Downtime Activities</h4>
					<p>
						In between game sessions you will have several activities available to you. These activities
						will help lower your heat, attempt to run cons to get money, speak with contacts to gather intel
						on the next mission.
					</p>

					<h4>Faction Renown</h4>
					<p>
						The factions of the city are living breathing organizations with rewards for loyalty. As you
						work with these organizations you will level up within the factions. These levels will grant you
						increased benefits in the world at large.
					</p>

					<h5>City Guard Renown - Heat Points</h5>
					<p>
						Drawing negative attention to yourself or your crew during heists and missions will cause your
						character to gain heat points. After a certain amount of heat points you will increase in level
						with the City Guard. The following are some examples of actions that might draw heat from the
						City Guard.
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Caught during a heist or break-in</li>
						<li>Murders attributed to you with reasonable certainty</li>
						<li>Restrained or questioned by the city guard</li>
						<li>Botched con jobs during the downtime</li>
						<li>Chased by the guards</li>
						<li>Unsanctioned public use of magic</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						Examples of some of the effects of gaining renown levels with the City Guard:
					</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Level 1 - If spotted for more than 10 mins by a city guard member, 50% chance of being
							brought in for interrogation.
						</li>
						<li>Level 2 - If spotted for more than 1 min by a city guard member, 75% chance of an attempted
							arrest.
							BOLO put out for figure matching your description.
						</li>
						<li>
							Level 3 - An arrest warrant is issued for your cover identity. The City Guard is on high
							alert. The City Guard patrols the district where you were last seen. If visual confirmation
							of you is made in public the City Guard will put out an alert in the city.
						</li>
						<li>Level >= 4 - It only gets worse from here...</li>
					</ol>
					<p>
						Some activities that will allow you to lower your heat points are:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Laying low in a hideout during your downtime - 30% heat point reduction</li>
						<li>Bribing low level guards - 0-40% heat point reduction based on the guard, the bribe, and
							luck
						</li>
						<li>Paying for a new cover identity - 70% heat point reduction</li>
					</ul>

					<p>
						With the destruction of many of the wizard schools and the outlawing of unsanctioned magic, the
						remaining wizards went underground. Over time they were able to form an underground network of
						magic users. They have a bitter hatred of the King and his mistreatment of thier kind. Citizen
						involvement in the exposing of unsanctioned magic users has made contacting the Arcane
						Collective a challenging and dangerous affair.

					We've decided to record and share our profane, raucous, and generally unorthodox games of D&D.
					Check back quasi weekly (official playing period) for updates.
					At no point are these podcasts safe for younger audiences or the weak of stomach.
					Flexible morals advised for listening pleasure.

				<div class="mdl-cell mdl-cell--9-col">
					<p>
						The history and starting world are detailed <a href="index.html#overview">here</a>.
						In general we started in a dystopian, authoritarian version of Waterdeep where evocation spells have been outlawed except by registered magic users.
						Red wizards were used as weapons by the king and all other schools of magic went underground.
						Early missions were almost always setup as individual heists or information, items, or persons of interest. Each player started
						by creating a character who was looking for work within the Zhentarim.
					</p>
					<p>
						At the start of the first podcast the players are level 6 and they have just managed to kill the King.
						Immediately following the King's death, Tzit Tzit the Brood Lich appears and reveals himself to the party.
						He informs them of this plans to end all of existence by destroying the Lady of Pain in the heart of the other planes of existence.
						He then floats out over the people of Waterdeep and levitates the entire City of the Dead into the air, revealing
						an ancient temple below the graveyard. Tzit Tzit then rips a portal in the fabric of space and time into the elemental planes of existence.
						The temple with the graveyard and Tzit Tzit himself exit through the new portal.
					</p>
					<p>
						Water pours from the portal filling the crater that was the graveyard of Waterdeep, creating a lake which threatens to flood the town.
